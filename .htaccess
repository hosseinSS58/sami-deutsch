# This file is optional and may not be needed if using Passenger directly

# Enable Passenger
PassengerEnabled On

# Uncomment and adjust these lines if needed:
# PassengerAppRoot /home/username/public_html
# PassengerBaseURI /
# PassengerPython /home/username/virtualenv/public_html/3.8/bin/python

# Redirect all requests to passenger_wsgi.py
# This is usually handled automatically by cPanel's Python App setup
